## About Us

The YMMOR-committee consists of young researchers that are interested in the continuation and further improvement of the conference format. Its purpose is the sustainability of the format independent of a particular institute or current conference organizers.

## Becoming a member

Every young researcher (PhD or early Postdoc) in the field of model order reduction is welcome to
join the committee! Being a regular member does not come with any obligations, although you should of
course try to attend the committee meetings which are held approximately 2-4 times per year. We also expect all members to spread th knowledge about the conference to other young researchers, e.g. at conferences or workshops.

If you are interested or have any questions, please send an (informal) mail to our recruitment manager ([lukas.renelt@uni-muenster.de](mailto:lukas.renelt@uni-muenster.de)).
