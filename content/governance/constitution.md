**§1: Foundation of YMMOR**
-

**1.1 Intention**

The key idea of YMMOR is to regularly bring together early career researchers that are working in the field of Model Order Reduction and related topics. The focus of the conference is scientific exchange and networking in an informal atmosphere among PhD students, master students, and early postdocs.

**1.2 Conference format**

The conference is held once per year. The venue is not fixed and is selected on a year-to-year basis. The following parts are integral to every conference edition:
- An introductory session
- Contributed talks by every participant
- One or multiple networking/socializing opportunities
- Collection of feedback from the participants

**1.3 Participation of professors**

The participation of people holding the position of a professor in the conference is not intended. This includes (non-exhaustive):
- Actively contributing to an organizing team
- The presentation of an introductory talk or plenary/invited talk
- Attending the conference in the audience

This limitation is set to ensure an informal atmosphere. Exceptions are possible with the committees approval (see §2.5.4).


**§2: The YMMOR-committee**
-

**2.1 Intention**

The YMMOR-committee ensures the sustainability of the conference format across particular conference editions. This mainly includes the formation and supervision of an organizing team for the next conference edition, the adherence to the conferences foundations (§1) and potential changes to that, as well as self-organizing duties.

**2.2 Members**

The number of members is not limited. This also applies to multiple people from the same institution.

*2.2.1 Eligibility:* Every PhD or early Postdoc that works in a field related to Model Order Reduction may become a member of the committee.

*2.2.2 Application:* Applications for new members are to be sent to and approved by the recruitment manager. This can be done in an informal way (email).

*2.2.3 Retirement:* Every member has the duty to inform the recruitment manager in case they are no longer interested in  the participation in the committee. In case they were the only member representing their institution they should propose a replacement member.

*2.2.4 Duties:* Members are required to regularly attend the committees meetings. In addition, they commit themselves to spread the knowledge about the conference to other young researchers.


**2.3 Voting rights**

The number of votes is limited to **1** per institution. If an institution is represented in the committee by multiple members they are required to agree on a common vote (relative majority). If no majority can be found the institution abstains from voting in the particular decision to be made.

*2.3.1 Quorum:* The committee is validly instituted if at least one third of the members are present. Depending on the decision either 50% (absolute majority) or 2/3 (two-thirds-majority) of the *attending* members need to approve the proposal.

**2.4 Committee positions**

*2.4.1 Eligibility:* Every member of the committee is eligible to the committee positions. A member can only hold one position at the same time.

*2.4.2 Election:* The positions are elected for the duration of one year (absolute majority vote). If no candidate reaches an absolute majority, an additional run-off voting is held. The elections should be held in the timespan of one month after the last conference edition.

*2.4.3 Positions:*

* **Recruitment manager**: They will contact work groups from the field of MOR that are not yet present in the committee and encourage them to join the conference / committee or relay the information to coworkers, supervised PhDs etc. They also make sure that people leaving the committee propose a replacement from their affiliation.

* **Sustainability manager**: They speak to people that might be interested in hosting the next edition of YMMOR. If there are no applications they should contact suitable hosts.

* **Technical manager**: They are responsible for the mailing list, the GitHub organization/repository and the website.

* **Advisor**: They are the contact person for the current organizers and support them in the organization of the next conference edition (depending on the support needed). In addition to the committee, they in particular ensure that the current organizers stick to the conferences ideas/standards detailed in §1. Thus, they should join their meetings regularly (at least every 2-3 months).

* **Head of Committee**: They are the contact person for the people filling the committee positions and the other committee members. They initiate and lead the committee meetings and manage the internal communication.


**2.5 Conference organization**

*2.5.1. Organizing team:* The YMMOR-conferences are organized by a dedicated organizing team that consists of at least 3 people. It needs to include at least 2 people affiliated with the hosting institution.

*2.5.2 Duties before the conference:* The organizing team is required to present their status to the committee on request from the Head of Committee (1-2 times during the organization period). This status presentation can also be done by the corresponding advisor.

*2.5.3 Duties after the conference:*
- The organizers of the last conference edition are particularly responsible for the sustainability of the conference format. They are required to fill vacant committee positions without applications until a successor is found.
- The organizers of the last conference edition are required to share their assets (in particular the feedback of the participants) with the organizers of the next conference edition via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/YMMOR-Conferences/YMMOR-organization).

*2.5.4 Representation of YMMOR:* The organizing team pledges to respect the foundation of the conference format as detailed in §1 for the conference edition hosted by them. Any deviation from §1 requires approval by the committee (absolute majority).

**2.6 Committee assets**

The ownership of the YMMOR-committee GitHub repository and the YMMOR-committee website lies with the GitHub organization [`YMMOR-Conferences`](https://github.com/YMMOR-Conferences). Every member of the committee is entitled to become a member of the organization and be granted `Owner`-rights. Any future assets should be hosted independent of a particular committee-member or their affiliation.

**2.7 Amendments**
Every member can propose amendments to article §1 and §2. They then require approval from the committee (majority vote). Any change to §1 requires a two-thirds majority. For changes to §2 an absolute majority suffices.
