## Becoming a member

Every young researcher (PhD or early Postdoc) in the field of model order 
reduction is welcome to join the committee! 
Being a regular member does not come with any obligations, although you should of
course try to attend the committee meetings which are held approximately 2-4 
times per year. 
We also expect all members to spread knowledge about the conference to other 
young researchers, e.g. at conferences or workshops.

If you are interested or have any questions, please send an (informal) mail to 
our recruitment manager 
([lukas.renelt@uni-muenster.de](mailto:lukas.renelt@uni-muenster.de)).
