The **key idea of YMMOR** is to regularly bring together early career researchers that are working in Model Order Reduction and related topics. The focus of the conference is **scientific exchange** and **networking in an informal atmosphere** among PhD students, master students, and early postdocs. Therefore, participation by experienced researchers such as professors is not intended.

The conference takes place on a yearly basis. Every participant is usually expected to present his work in order to facilitate discussions. The talk is not required to discuss finished/published work - open questions or experiences from unsuccessful ideas are explicitly allowed. The conference program also puts a strong emphasis on exchange with multiple networking/socializing opportunities leaving space for discussions.
