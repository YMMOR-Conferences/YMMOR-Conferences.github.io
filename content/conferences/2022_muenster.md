The first edition of the YMMOR conference took place in July 2022 in Münster, Germany, and was funded by Mathematics Münster, Cluster of Excellence.
We had a great week with many interesting talks and discussions and also spent a lot of time with social activities to get to know each other.

The official homepage of the conference can be found [here](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/events/2022/YMCN-model-order-reduction.shtml).
