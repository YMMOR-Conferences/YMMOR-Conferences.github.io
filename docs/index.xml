      <description>The key idea of YMMOR is to regularly bring together early career researchers that are working in Model Order Reduction and related topics. The focus of the conference is scientific exchange and networking in an informal atmosphere among PhD students, master students, and early postdocs. Therefore, participation by experienced researchers such as professors is not intended.&#xA;The conference takes place on a yearly basis. Every participant is usually expected to present his work in order to facilitate discussions.</description>
