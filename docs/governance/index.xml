      <description>ยง1: Foundation of YMMOR 1.1 Intention
The key idea of YMMOR is to regularly bring together early career researchers that are working in the field of Model Order Reduction and related topics. The focus of the conference is scientific exchange and networking in an informal atmosphere among PhD students, master students, and early postdocs.
1.2 Conference format
The conference is held once per year. The venue is not fixed and is selected on a year-to-year basis.</description>
